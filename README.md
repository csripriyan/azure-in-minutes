# Publishing an mqtt packet from RPi3 to Azure IoT Hub : A no-frill step-by-step guide
# 1. OBJECTIVE:
This article is about setting up Azure IoT Hub, sending some data using mosquitto_pub from Raspberry Pi3 and ensuring that the data is received by Azure IoT Hub.
When I searched the Internet on how to get started with Azure IOT, I did not find any easy step-by-step guidance. In this article I have tried to put my findings together so that you would be able to push your first packet into Azure IoT cloud relatively quickly. I do not claim that this is a better method nor the only method available; but it would help you to start off easily.
